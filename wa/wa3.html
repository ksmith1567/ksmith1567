    <p>The following 66 National Olympic Committees have qualified athletes. Seven qualifiers and the hosts, Italy, were confirmed as qualified by the IIHF into the ice hockey tournament with Russia provisionally holding another spot.[28] However, its participation is uncertain due to the aftermath of the invasion of Ukraine starting in 2022. Russian athletes were not permitted to enter team events at the 2024 Summer Olympics in Paris. However, the matter of the terms of the eligibility of Russian athletes at the 2024 Summer Olympics was reported by the Associated Press as allowing 15 Russian 'neutrals' to fully participate and apparently allowing for the possibility for Kamila Valieva and others to participate as 'neutrals' at the 2026 Winter Olympics. The final decision on Russia in ice hockey is expected in early 2025. Other NOCs have had at least one male or female competitor meet the minimum alpine skiing requirements. The United Arab Emirates is expected to make its Winter Olympics debut. </p>

        <p>An online vote closing on 28 February 2023 was held among a list of candidates to select the two mascots of the event. The winning candidates, designed by the students of a school in Taverna and inspired by stoats, were presented during the second night of the Sanremo Music Festival 2024 on 7 February 2024. Their names were revealed to be Tina and Milo (derived from the names of the host cities), and are portrayed as sister and brother. The choice of stoats has been explained as being due to these animals' embodiment of "the contemporary Italian spirit" of curiosity, ability to change according to the seasons, and capacity of adaptation to challenging habitats. The two main mascots are additionally accompanied by six snowdrop flowers, called "The Flo".</p>
        <p>Milo, a brown stoat, and Tina, a white stoat, are brother and sister "born in the mountains of Italy", who "decided to move to the city". Tina, the main Olympic mascot, symbolizes art, music, and the transformative force of beauty. Milo, the Paralympic mascot, was born without a leg but uses his tail to help him walk, representing ingenuity, willpower, and creativity.</p>
